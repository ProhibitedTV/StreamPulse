# StreamPulse

StreamPulse is a dynamic news and stock ticker display application designed for live streaming. It scrapes multiple RSS news feeds across different categories and displays stories in a visually appealing, quadrant-based layout. Additionally, it provides real-time stock prices using the Alpha Vantage and Yahoo Finance APIs, making it perfect for capturing with OBS for live streaming purposes.

## Features

- **News Feeds**: Displays stories from categories like General, Financial, Video Games, and Science/Tech, dynamically updating them in their respective quadrants.
- **Stock Ticker**: Real-time stock prices displayed in a scrolling ticker at the bottom of the screen, utilizing fallback support to Yahoo Finance in case Alpha Vantage's API limit is hit.
- **UI Design**: Optimized for full-screen display on a 1080p monitor, with transitions between news stories and a smooth-scrolling stock ticker for an enhanced visual experience.
  
## Recent Improvements

- **Smooth Scrolling Stock Ticker**: The stock ticker now scrolls across the bottom of the screen, ensuring that all stock prices are visible without requiring manual scrolling. The ticker speed can be easily adjusted for a smoother display, and fallback to Yahoo Finance ensures reliability even when the Alpha Vantage API hits its request limit.
- **Yahoo Finance Fallback**: If Alpha Vantageâ€™s API rate limit is reached, the application seamlessly switches to Yahoo Finance for retrieving stock data. This guarantees continuous updates without interruptions.
- **Improved Responsiveness**: The overall UI responsiveness has been enhanced to ensure smooth transitions between news stories and a visually appealing experience for viewers.
